In this work, We modifies the Python package Bilby, and enable it to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on space-borne GW detectors. The code is available in our [github page][https://github.com/Li-mz/bilby/tree/SpaceInterferometer]. We investigated the improvements of GW source localization and constraint on parity-violating gravity given by space-borne GW detector networks.
