title: "Constraining parity asymmetry of gravity with joint observations of space-borne gravitational-wave detectors"
collection: publications
#permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'In this work, we investigated the constraint on parity-violating (PV) gravity given by joint observation of space-borne gravitational-wave detectors (i.e., LISA, Tianqin and Taiji). The constraint on PV gravity is weaker than that given by LIGO due to the lower frequency band. Bayesian method is employed in this work with our modified the Python package Bilby. '

In this work, we investigated the constraint on parity-violating (PV) gravity given by joint observation of space-borne gravitational-wave detectors (i.e., LISA, Tianqin and Taiji). The constraint on PV gravity is weaker than that given by LIGO due to the lower frequency band. Bayesian method is employed in this work with our modified the Python package Bilby.
