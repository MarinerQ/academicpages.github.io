### 2021
* **Qian Hu**, Mingzheng Li, Rui Niu, and Wen Zhao. *Joint Observations of Space-borne Gravitationalwave Detectors: Source Localization and Implication for Parity-violating Gravity*, Phys. Rev. D 103, 064057
    * Bayesian parameter estimation on space-borne GW detectors. We investigated the improvements of GW source localization and constraint on parity-violating gravity given by space-borne GW detector networks. 
    * You may find the paper in the [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05670) and [paper url](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.064057).

    * A method to decompose the circular polarizations of GWs produced during the inspiralling stage of compact binaries with the help of stationary phase approximation. A model-independent test of the parity symmetry of gravity.
