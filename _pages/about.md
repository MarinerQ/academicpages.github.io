Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a PhD student at [Institute for Gravitational Research](http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/igr/index.php), University of Glasgow. Before coming to Glasgow, I was an undergraduate at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) majoring in astrophysics. I work on parameter estimation and data analysis of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. I'm especially interested in the robust (and hopefully fast) data analysis for future high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) GW detection.
